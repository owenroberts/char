Part 1

I used to believe in an afterlife, or like think about one.  I kind of thought real life was temporary, like a trip to the beach.  

Hey, do you want to get hot dogs?  I haven’t had a hot dog in a long time.

Anyway, my parents were avowed atheists, so believing in the afterlife was kind of like my little secret.

My best friend went to church, he showed me depictions of heaven and hell in his illustrated bible.  He told me basically everyone is a sinner, which made sense.

My idea of the afterlife was not like that though, it was more like there was no space, no time, so like, without time, you wouldn’t have to sleep or get hungry or whatever.

I could never sleep when I was younger.  I just would watch the moon from my window during the summer months and during the winter months I would just watch the stars and black sky.

It’s so weird eating a hotdog, it happens so fast it’s like it didn’t happen at all.  Like I don’t even remember what it tasted like.

In the afterlife they’re probably not like eating hotdogs all the time.  Well, I don’t know, maybe they are.

* But if time’s not moving you wouldn’t get hungry.  You wouldn’t eat a hotdog and then just forget about it.

When I was in fourth grade I ate a hot dog for lunch every single day.  On the last day of fourth grade my parents picked me up together, they were taking me out as like a reward for passing fourth grade.

My mother asked if I wanted to get a hot dog, because I had told her it was my favorite food.  I was so sick of hotdogs, I announced, “I’ll never eat a hot dog again!”

Doesn’t eating a hotdog feel like a sin?  I guess most things feel like sins.  But there’s no way its good, you know?  If they’re eating hotdogs somewhere it’s in hell.  

It’s so easy to do, you do it without thinking, without thinking about pigs getting all fucked up and all the other terrible shit that makes a hotdog cost a dollar or whatever.  

It has to be a sin.  I think if you believe in heaven and hell, you know there’s probably just hell.

Part 2

After the fourth grade, my family moved to the suburbs twenty minutes away from the house where I had grown up, where my best friend had lived next door, on the other side of a brick wall.  My parents told us together and we both cried.

My best friend came to visit on a Saturday two weeks after we moved and though my parents said it was a short drive, he said it was really far, past the science museum and the high school and the soccer field.  

We walked through the vast backyard behind my new house and into the woods and then after what felt like hours we emerged into another vast backyard and there, what we could only have imagined in our wildest dreams, was a full size trampoline.

We were scared at first.  It was silent behind the massive brick house.  The backyard stretched on infinitely with no other houses visible in any direction, no people, no animals, just the motionless, black trampoline alone in the middle of the still field of light green, short cut grass.

We hid behind a tree at the edge of the woods and watched the trampoline.   There were no lights on in the house.  We decided there must be no one home and my friend took the first steps out of the woods, towards the trampoline.

The hours passed as we bounced and bounced.  We performed flips and back tucks and aerials.  We jumped from the edge and rolled into the grass like we were being thrown from an exploding airplane.  When we got tired we lay on our backs, our weight shifting the taught surface of the trampoline up and down by millimeters, looking at the sky.

We both froze when we heard a low, indistinct but clearly human voice coming from the direction of the house.  A woman approached, as she got closer, we made eye contact, and there was a moment we could have just taken off running, but we were both frozen.

When she was standing above us we saw she was smiling.  She said, “I’m glad someone is getting some use from this old thing.  Don’t be scared, I just wanted to say hello.”

She asked if we lived in the neighborhood and I kind of stammered that, Yes, I had just moved there.  She said, “Welcome to the neighborhood,” and left us alone.  We watched until she was back in the house and then found our way back to my house.

The next weekend I went by myself to the trampoline.  I was doing back tucks, trying to make myself into a smaller and smaller ball each time.  Suddenly the woman was there.  She said, “Hi,” and I froze mid jump and almost fell off the trampoline.

She said, “Why aren’t you in Church?”  It was Sunday morning.  I said, “We don’t go to Church,” and she said, “Me neither.” 

I stoped jumping and I asked her, “Do you believe in Hell?”  She laughed and said, “No, not really.”  I had never talked to an adult about my made up afterlife.

I told her about my version of hell, based on what my friend had told me and my own idea that there would be no time and I wouldn’t have to fall asleep.  She said, “That sounds nice,” and “What else happens in hell?”

I don’t know how long it was, a week, a month, maybe a year, when I was in the car with my mom and she told me, “Mrs. Augustine told me about your ideas about the afterlife, she said it was very interesting.  She said I should ask you about it.”  

I turned bright red and I couldn’t speak.  I told my mom I had just been joking.  She didn’t seem to believe me.
